WARNING: THIS IS A PRE-ALPHA RELEASE OF THE LAMMPS WORLD PROGRAM. THIS RELEASE MAY CONTAIN BUGS
AND GLITCHES.

Note: This program is an early conceptual prototype. Its functionality has not been sufficiently tested
nor has it been confirmed to be reliable.

The folder codenamed "sudoku" contains the source code. Please read the "info.txt" document provided there, and
the user's manual contained within, before proceeding. This folder is within the "workspace" folder. Use the
"workspace" folder from the root of your system ("/workspace/sudoku.... etc", not "mydir/workspace/sudoku...."),
else the programm may not recognize the file paths that it uses to run the simulations.

This program was designed for a Linux based framework similar to the filesystem in D-Wave's IDE, assuming a classical system emulated on a quantum computer of 4000 qubits or above.

This is an application used for creating planetary-level, large-sized all-atom molecular dynamics
simulations of ecosystem- and terrain-inclusive worlds. See the "info.txt" document for more information.
